-> Deque which is also known as Doubly Ended Queue.
Note:
The major difference between the normal queue and the deque is that the node/data can be inserted/deleted from both the FRONT and the REAR of the queue.
  
Doubly Ended Queue can be implemented using a Doubly LinkedList.

Applications:
-> DoublyEnded queue can be used to implement LRU cache where the insertion/deletion of the node from the front/rear pointer is performed in O(1) Time Complexity.
